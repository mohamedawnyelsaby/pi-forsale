It offers Dual Network Support (Testnet/Mainnet), allowing users to switch between environments, and it includes example logic for "Escrow Payment" for large Mainnet purchases. Products are subject to AI Smart Sorting, where they are prioritized based on an assigned "AI Rating" score and highlighted by the "AI Pick" badge. Customer support is handled by the simulated Logy AI Assistant, ready to answer questions about shipping, disputes, and recommendations. The shopping cart is Dynamic, showing a real-time update of the total cart value in Pi and USD equivalent. The design is Fully Responsive, optimized for both desktop browsers and mobile viewing (specifically the Pi Browser). Finally, the application includes basic Multilingual Support (RTL/LTR) for both English and Arabic.
